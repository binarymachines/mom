# cumulative errors
# cause of defect
# rate of decay

# persistence of mode state allow modes to be restored and replayed, allowing analysis of transitions between mode state snapshots, which describes traverals

# The mildred exception hierarchy persists metrics across sessions, which will be implemented by Selector2 the presenter of this alternative to the switch api
# at the lower implementation level, decorators using the transitionhandler pattern are added to ensure error reception and report

# transition of mode from one state to another is determined by adminstrators of state

# insight recognizes changes at the level of introspection
